# Kiwi
A pure Kotlin library with common code that can be used across projects

## Warning
This a personal library, and is not intended to be used by others. The Api may change at anytime.

## Animations
A collection of entities and functions that make dealing animations simpler

Entities:
*Coordinate* contains an x and y coordinate
*Rectangle* a bounded rectangle that can be animated

## Colors
A collection of entities and functions that make dealing with colors simpler

Entities:
*RgbColor*
*HexColor*

## Extensions
A collection of functions that are named in an appropriate manner that allows them to be used from simply looking at a classes autocomplete.

## Logging
Classes to simplify exceptions and logging. This package needs a lot of work.

## Platform
To follow a use case driven, multi-module architecture or to use multi platform projects, the common/usecase module must have access to pure kotlin interfaces of platform implementations. For example, Toasts are a platform detail and the common module can not know toasts exist, so to display a toast the common module must call an interface. This interface has an implementation in an android module and the the hook-up is achieved via dependency injection.

Platform interfaces include:
**Announcer** Toasts, Snackbars, Alert dialogs.
**Analytics** Send events and exceptions to analytics.
**ResourceProvider** For example, Strings
**TimeWrapper** Common time behaviour
